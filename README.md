Install
===========================
Add the following in the Gemfile.
```ruby
gem 'rails3-template', :git => 'git://github.com/ashrafuzzaman/rails3-template.git'
```

Nested scaffold
===========================
rails generate nested_scaffold comment title:string blog:references user:references

Explanation:
The parent resource is choosen from the first decleared references type. Here the parent resource is blog.

Now it only supports erb template.

Note
===========================
Nested scaffold already exists for rails 3, still I had to build yet another because of the following reasons,
* I plan to use my own template to generate scaffolds, but if I use nested_scaffold generator of nifty-generators then they generate with their own template.
* Most of the generators over rides too many rails libraries which might cause them to break at some point(if they dont maintain the gem).

What it actually does
===========================
* Generates all the files that are generated by traditional scaffold, and then use regex to replace links in the views to support nested_scaffold.
* Controller is over written by my own template. But as we all know the template engine of rails generator, any one can over ride my template.

Install my templates
===========================
I preffer to use twitter bootstrap. So you can install twitter bootstrap supported templates by,
```ruby
rails g template:install
```
